        <center><p>Hello! My name is Jermaine Lamarr Cole aka "J. Cole". I was born and raised on a military base in Frankfurt, Germany and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. I have always had a passion for music at the age of 12. Inspired by rappers such as Nas, Canibus, and Eminem, Cole began filling notebooks with rhymes and learned to make beats on an 808 drum machine his mother bought for him.</p>
